# Quality Assurance Documentation - Established and Built Comprehensive Azure DevOps Project Wiki

I established and am actively expanding a comprehensive Azure DevOps Project Wiki for the PHA-Web project, designed as a shared, organization-wide resource that serves as the single source of truth for quality assurance, testing standards, department guidance, cross-team processes, and modernization strategy.

## Key efforts include:

- Structuring the wiki in a Hub-and-Spoke format with tailored content for three audience levels: executives (high-level roadmaps and strategies), managers/team leads (processes and oversight), and individual contributors (detailed how-to guides and references).

- Creating dedicated sections for multiple departments, including in-depth QA coverage (career paths for Q1–Q3, SDET1–SDET3, QA-Lead/SDET-Lead, Principal roles; training resources; and detailed Playwright automation architecture, standards, examples, and future extensions), as well as sections for Development, Data Conversion (DCON), and Customer Support workflows.

- Building extensive QA Testing documentation covering automated UI testing (Playwright suite structure, authentication/state management, flakiness prevention, CI/CD execution, diagnostics, and local workflows), manual testing approaches, test types/definitions, environment strategies, and templates.

- Adding cross-cutting areas such as Quality Engineering & Modernization Strategy, branching/CI/CD practices, Azure DevOps usage, standardized page models/markdown templates, and a tagging system to ensure consistency and discoverability across all departments.

## What do we gain from this shared, organization-wide wiki?

- **Cross-department collaboration and alignment**: Development, Data Conversion, Customer Support, and QA teams all have dedicated spaces while benefiting from shared standards, processes, and visibility into each other’s workflows.

- **Multi-level accessibility**: Executives gain strategic overviews, managers find governance guidance, and team members access practical instructions—all centralized in one location.

- **Stronger department identity and growth**: Clear QA role definitions, career paths, and training resources support talent development and retention.

- **Higher testing and delivery quality**: Comprehensive standards and examples accelerate consistent practices, especially around automation, while reducing variability.

Though only a few weeks old as of late December 2025, the wiki is already seeing adoption across teams, with contributors and viewers from multiple departments—a strong early indicator of its value in reducing knowledge silos and supporting our modernization goals.

This living resource continues to grow into an essential tool that empowers the entire organization, streamlines onboarding, and drives higher overall quality and efficiency.
