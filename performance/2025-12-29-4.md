# UI Testing Strategy - Designed and Implemented Scalable Three-Project Playwright Framework

I designed and implemented a scalable, standards-compliant Playwright automation framework consisting of three dedicated projects to promote separation of concerns, reusability, and maintainability.

## Projects created:

- **uiTests.PlaywrightTests**: Contains the actual test cases using xUnit, leveraging fixtures and theories for data-driven testing.

- **uiTests.PlaywrightUtilities**: Houses shared core logic, helpers, custom extensions, page object models, and reusable components (e.g., login handlers, state management).

- **uiTests.PlaywrightTools**: A console application that utilizes logic from PlaywrightUtilities to generate and manage authentication storage states (LoginState files) and test user configurations.

## What do we gain from this three-project structure?

- **Clear separation of concerns**: Tests remain focused on scenarios, while utilities centralize reusable logic and tools handle operational/support tasks.

- **Improved maintainability and onboarding**: New team members can quickly locate test cases, shared components, or tooling without digging through a monolithic project.

- **Secure and efficient authentication management**: Centralized generation of LoginState files enables fast, repeatable logins across local and CI/CD runs.

- **Enhanced reusability and standards compliance**: Promotes DRY principles, facilitates pipeline integration, and aligns with industry best practices for large-scale Playwright implementations.

This foundation positions us for rapid expansion of UI automated test coverage with consistent quality and reduced technical debt.
