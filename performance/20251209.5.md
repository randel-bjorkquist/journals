# Code Improvements - Architected and Engineered mcsCore.Utilities, a Feature-Based Reusable Tools Library

I designed and implemented `mcsCore.Utilities`, a .NET Standard 2.0 C# class library that serves as the centralized, reusable foundation for general-purpose tools and cross-cutting features across our ecosystem.

## Key efforts include:

- Architecting the library using Vertical Slice / Feature-based Clean Architecture, organizing code into dedicated feature folders (`Compression`, `Encryption`, `Impersonation`, `Pipeline`, `File`) with a shared Common area for core elements.

- Implementing pluggable `Strategy Pattern` designs with factories for Compression (`Brotli`, `GZip`, `NoCompression`) and Encryption (`Aes`, `TripleDes`, `NoEncryption`), enabling runtime interchangeability without code changes.

- Building the Pipeline feature to orchestrate flexible file movement between disks and streams, applying configurable compression and encryption separately for "AtRest" and "InTransit" scenarios.

- Developing the core File feature for robust binary and text file handling (read/write to disk or streams), integrating `Pipeline`, `Compression`, `Encryption`, and `Impersonation` while incorporating the `Result Pattern` for clear success/failure handling.

- Creating supporting infrastructure in Common, including Logging, Result Pattern objects, Helpers, Extensions, and enums; adding Impersonation capabilities with optional privilege elevation.

- Establishing comprehensive test coverage via the accompanying mcsCore.Utilities.Tests project (.NET 8) using xUnit, Moq, Serilog, Shouldly, and SkippableFact, including Unit, Integration, Infrastructure, and Performance tests.

## What do we gain from this centralized, architected utilities library?

- **High reusability and reduced duplication**: Common tools and secure file operations are implemented once and shared across all projects.

- **Flexibility and extensibility**: Strategy Pattern and factories allow seamless addition or swapping of algorithms (e.g., new compression/encryption types) with zero impact on consuming code.

- **Enhanced security and reliability**: Configurable encryption/compression at rest and in transit, safe impersonation, and Result Pattern usage minimize errors and improve operational safety.

- **Strong maintainability and quality**: Clean architecture, thorough test coverage (all test types), and modern C# practices ensure long-term stability and easier onboarding.

`mcsCore.Utilities` now provides a solid, secure, and extensible foundation that supports current legacy needs while positioning us for future modernization and broader reuse.
