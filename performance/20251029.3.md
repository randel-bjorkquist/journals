# UI Testing Strategy - Researched Modern Tools and Adopted Microsoft Playwright via POCs

I conducted a POC (proof-of-concept) evaluation of Selenium and Microsoft Playwright to identify the most suitable modern UI automation framework for our testing needs, selecting Playwright as the clear winner.

## Key efforts included:

- Building a comprehensive Playwright POC with representative test scenarios (login flows, data entry, navigation, and assertions).

- Creating a lighter side-by-side Selenium POC using the same scenarios to enable direct comparison of API design, code readability, and ease of implementation.

- Researching industry benchmarks, community feedback, and real-world comparisons from trusted sources (Microsoft documentation, Stack Overflow, testing blogs, and open-source projects) on performance, reliability, and feature sets.

Outcome: Microsoft Playwright was selected as our primary UI automation framework moving forward.

## What do we gain from choosing Playwright over Selenium?

- **Faster and more reliable test execution**: Industry benchmarks consistently show Playwright's auto-waiting and dynamic content handling dramatically reduce flakiness compared to Selenium.

- **True cross-browser testing**: Consistent behavior across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single codebase, without the browser-specific workarounds often required in Selenium.

- **Superior developer experience**: Cleaner, more concise API; built-in tracing, video recording, and inspector tools that streamline debugging—evident even in my side-by-side POC code.

- **Better future-proofing**: Actively developed by Microsoft with excellent .NET support, modern async patterns, and advanced features like network interception and mobile emulation.

This research-driven decision, validated through hands-on POCs, reduces future test maintenance effort, improves pipeline reliability, and enables broader coverage with cleaner, more maintainable code.
