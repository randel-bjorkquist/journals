# Code Improvements (Transition to Modern .NET Architecture)

I have been building the foundational structure to enable the modernization of our legacy ASP.NET Web Application (currently on .NET Framework 4.7), restructuring the middle-tier and laying the groundwork for a full transition to .NET 8+.

## Key efforts include:

- Establishing `mcsCore.Utilities` and related assemblies as the foundation for shared, reusable components.

- Migrating legacy business logic and data access code from the web project into the middle-tier `mcsCore.Services` class library (currently targeting .NET Standard 2.0 for maximum compatibility with the existing Framework 4.7 web app).

- Building new unit and integration testing projects on .NET 8+ to leverage modern testing frameworks, async support, and performance improvements.

- Designing the architecture with future upgrade in mind: once all legacy dependencies are extracted and refactored into `mcsCore.Services`, the middle-tier will be upgraded to .NET 8+, enabling end-to-end modern .NET benefits (performance, security updates, cross-platform potential, and simplified maintenance).

## What do we gain from this modernization approach?

- **Future-proofing & Long-term Support**: Moves us off the aging .NET Framework (end-of-support looming) to actively supported .NET 8+ with regular LTS releases.

- **Improved Performance & Developer Productivity**: Access to modern language features (C# 12+), better async patterns, and optimized runtime.

- **Cleaner Separation of Concerns**: Decouples business logic from the web UI, making the codebase more maintainable, testable, and reusable across potential future front-ends.

- **Enhanced Testability**: New tests in .NET 8+ benefit from faster execution, modern assertions, and better tooling, while the phased migration minimizes risk to production.

This structured transition reduces technical debt, lowers maintenance costs, and positions the application for continued evolution without major rewrites.
